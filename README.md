# img-exif-exporter
exports raw exif data as csv file. very basic concept. works reasonably fast, even with batches of 1000 images.
This is a quick thing i coded up, so its neither tested properly noe has a nice interface. it's console only. 
use at own discretion.

# how to use

1. run the script
2. enter the path to the images, of which you want the exif data
3. press enter and a folder "exported-exif" will be created. In there you will find the csv files with the exif-data of your images
