# img-exif-exporter
exports raw exif data as csv file. very basic concept. works reasonably fast, even with batches of 1000 images.
This is a quick thing i coded up, so its neither tested properly nor has a nice interface. it's console only.

use at own discretion.

# how to use

1. run the script
2. enter the path to the images, of which you want the exif data
3. press enter and a folder "exported-exif" will be created. In there you will find the csv files with the exif-data of your images

# version history
current version is v0.9, as it has not all features i want it to have implemented. if i ever update it, it will get the feature to sort batches of images to date and time they were taken and moved to folders which correspond to the date in the exif data

time frame: when i have motivation lol
